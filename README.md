# Bacterial Phylum in the Termite gut community
### **Computational Biology (BIOL 425) Capstone Project**
In the context of this report, I investigated the following question: *Do particular bacterial phyla dominate the gut microbiota of specific subfamilies or feeding groups of termites?* This investigation involved an exploration of microbiota diversity within the hindguts of 18 termite species. The report relies on existing data regarding the bacterial composition within termite guts, as outlined in the research paper titled: "Diet is the primary determinant of bacterial community structure in the guts of higher termites."
